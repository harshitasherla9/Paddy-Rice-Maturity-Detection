# Paddy-Rice-Maturity-Detection

This project was developed as part of the Final Year Engineering Project in the Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology in 2024. It was a collaborative effort by a team of two members, aiming to develop an automated system for paddy rice maturity assessment using deep learning-based object detection models.

## **Overview**
Paddy rice maturity identification is a crucial agricultural task that impacts grain quality, production optimization, and harvest scheduling. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and subjective, prompting the need for automated solutions. This project presents a **comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLOv4** object detection models for assessing paddy rice maturity using deep learning and digital imaging.

## **Features**
- **Automated detection of paddy rice maturity stages** using deep learning.
- **Comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLOv4** for object detection performance.
- **Training and evaluation of models** on an annotated dataset of paddy rice images.
- **Analysis of detection accuracy, processing speed, and model efficiency**.

## **System Architecture**
The project utilizes **deep learning-based object detection** for maturity assessment. The architecture includes:
- **Dataset collection and preprocessing**: Images annotated with bounding boxes for maturity stage classification.
- **YOLOv4 Model**: Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for object detection with Darknet or CSPDarknet as backbone networks.
- **YOLOv8 Model**: Enhanced with Cross-Stage Partial Connections (CSPC) and Context Aggregation Modules (CAM) for improved accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics such as **precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP)**, and inference time are used to assess model effectiveness.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - Ultralytics YOLO
  - OpenCV (Image Processing)
  - Google Colab (GPU Training)
  - LabelImg (Image Annotation)

## **Dataset**
- **Collected from various sources** representing different growth stages of paddy rice.
- **5 maturity stages** labeled: Nursery, Transplantation, Panicle Initiation, Panicle Visible, and Mature.
- **Manual annotation using LabelImg** to create ground truth data.

## **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Training on Google Colab using GPU acceleration**.
- **Optimization with data augmentation**, hyperparameter tuning, and loss function refinement.
- **Evaluation metrics**:
  - **Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95**
  - **Confusion matrix analysis**
  - **F1-score, PR curve, loss curves**

## **Results**
- **YOLOv8 outperformed YOLOv4** in precision (14% vs. 0%), recall (18% vs. 0%), and mAP (10% vs. 0.1%).
- **YOLOv4 struggled with overlapping bounding boxes**, resulting in lower detection performance.
- **Visualization using loss curves, PR curve, and confusion matrices** provided deeper insights.
